### Project Scope  
  
- The main objective of this project shows how network connection information can be modeled as chromosomes. 
   The objective of the system 	is to create a new set of rules during run time. So the intruder cannot be able 
   to  attack the system with virus.                
 - In recent years, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has become one  
	of the hottest research areas in Computer Security. It is an important  
	detection technology and is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity  and system availability during an intrusion.  
  
- An Intrusion Detection System is a system for detecting  
	intrusions and reporting them accurately to the proper authority. Intrusion  
	Detection Systems are usually specific to the operating system that they  
	operate in and are an important tool in the overall implementation an  
	organizationâ€™s information security policy, which reflects an organization's  
	statement by defining the rules and practices to provide security.  
  
- A methodology of applying genetic algorithm into network intrusion  
	detection technique is unique as it considers both temporal and spatial  
	information of network connections during the encoding of the problem;  
	therefore, it should be more helpful for identification of network anomalous  behaviors.

### About the Project
  
This project aims at developing a Network Packet Sniffer. Network  
Packet Sniffer is a piece of software that monitors all network traffic. <br>
This  is unlike standard network hosts that only receive traffic sent specifically to them.<br> 
As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet  and eventually decodes and analyzes its content. <br>
For network monitoring  purposes it may also be desirable to monitor all data packets in a LAN and to  mirror all packets passing through a shared bus.  
  
This project will be comprised of three modules namely the User Interface module, 
Statistics module and Packet Analysis module.<br>User Interface module provides all the Graphical Interface components necessary for the user  to interact with the System. <br>
The Analysis Module will analyze the incoming packets into a computer, identify them and passes the information into the  Statistics module.<br>
Finally the statistics module does the necessary calculation based on the information and produce information that can be understood by the user.  

This system is thus very useful to the users and a network  
administrator in particular who is generally responsible for monitoring things  
on a network.  
  
This system is a network analyzer (also known as protocol analyzer  
& packet sniffer), it performs real-time packet capturing, 24x7 network  
monitoring, advanced protocol analyzing, in-depth packet decoding, and  
automatic expert diagnosing. It allows you to get a clear view of the complex  
network, conduct packet level analysis, and troubleshoot network problems.  
  
This system is useful for a network administrator who needs to  
identify, diagnose, and solve network problems, a company manager who wants to  monitor user activities on the network and ensure that the corporation's  communications assets are safe, or a consultant who has to quickly solve  network problems for clients.  
  
This provides an administrator with a full set of reports such as  
Summary view, Endpoints view, and Protocols view.

### Existing System
As a network administrator who needs to identify, diagnose, and  
solve network problems, a company manager who wants to monitor user activities  on the network and ensure that the corporation's communications assets are  safe, or a consultant who has to quickly solve network problems for clients. It  is difficult to identify the problems if the network traffic is not tracked, as  an administrator in general we depend on the analyzer provided by the operating  system (if any) or the anti virus software that is installed to provide real-time  network security. However, it is identified that these systems provide specific  set of reports which may not be enough for an administrator to trace all the  problems. To handle these types of issues we want to implement a specific  network analyzer that can track all the incoming and outgoing calls.  
  
The Conversations tab allows us to monitor network traffic by each  
conversation and the figure out which conversation has generated the largest  
network traffic.  
  
###  Drawbacks with the Existing System
 - Administrators need to put lot of efforts to identify the traffic  
 - Time taking  process. 
 - No possibility of automatic network control.  
 - Presence of  administrator is compulsory.

 ### Proposed System  
  As a network analyzer (as a. packet sniffer), this system make it  easy for us to monitor and analyze network traffic in its intuitive and  information-rich tab views. With this system network traffic monitor feature,  we can quickly identify network bottleneck and detect network abnormities. This  
article is to discuss how we can monitor network traffic with this network  
traffic monitor feature.  
  
This system provides a Summary view that provides general  
information of the entire network or the selected node in the explorer. In  
Summary view we can get a quick view of the total traffic, real-time traffic,  
broadcast traffic, multicast traffic and so on. When we switch among the node  
from the explorer, corresponding traffic information will be provided.  
  
The Endpoints view; we can monitor network traffic information of  
each node, both local and remote. With its easy sorting feature we can easily  
find out which host is generating or has generated the largest traffic.  
  
The Protocols view will list all protocols applied in network  
transmission. In Protocols view we can monitor network traffic by each  
protocol. By analyzing network traffic by protocol, we can understand what  
applications are using the network bandwidth, for example "http"  
protocol stands for website browsing, "pop3" stands for email, etc.  
  
### Advantages with the proposed system 
 - Network Admin  can monitor the packets any where through out the world.  
 - Traffic can be  controlled  
 - System  performance will be increased  
 - Immediate generation  of reports on demand.  
 - Graphical data  is available to analyze the network.
